        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p>The field of management has changed a lot, showing a complex mix of new workplace trends, technology, and changing social values. Traditionally, management has been key to how organizations operate and shape our workdays, how we're evaluated, and the overall structure we work within. Lately, there's been a big push to make people and organizations more adaptable and skilled, with companies spending on training and consulting to help bring about change. However, these efforts will only work if management itself is open to change. The main issue is the conflict between wanting to innovate and the stiffness of old management ways. How can organizations encourage new ideas and diversity when everything is so standardized? Or support flexibility when there are so many rules? The challenge is more than just using new tools or methods; it's about changing how we view management, including how we work, think, and act.
        </p>
        <p>In looking for solutions, the idea of 'liberated companies' offers hope. These companies adopt a management style that's not about tight control but about fundamentally changing how they relate to their employees. Liberated companies focus on supporting and empowering their staff, moving beyond the usual roles of leaders and managers to tackle the complexities of modern management practices and values. This approach not only leads to better engagement with external groups like customers and suppliers but also encourages a culture of open conversation and trying new things. As we explore these changes in management, liberated companies provide a solid example for others to follow. By taking up this approach, companies can build a culture where being flexible, creative, and willing to take risks is part of the core values, making it easier to manage change in a more effective and lasting way.
        </p>
        <p>The Robert Dilts model, inspired by Gregory Bateson's work on learning, gives a detailed framework for understanding how change affects individuals and organizations. It breaks down change into six levels: Environment, Behaviors, Capabilities, Beliefs and Values, Identity, and Purpose. Each level covers a different aspect of our experiences, from the outer, tangible factors to the deeper, more personal ones. This model shows that changes at the higher levels can have a big impact on the lower levels, offering a strong way to guide transformation and growth. 
        </p>
        <p>In managing complex situations, Dilts' model suggests taking a detailed and systematic look beyond quick fixes. We use this model to deeply analyze the following companies: Decathlon, HCL Technologies, and Patagonia. They have gone through significant changes in their management styles. The next part will focus on how these companies applied these ideas and the results they achieved thanks to Dilts model.

        <h2>DECATHLON</h2>
        <img src="images/decathlon.jpeg" class="decathlon">
        <h3>A DIFFICULT PATH</h3>
        <h4>Behaviour</h4>
        <p>Decathlon's venture into transforming its management approach aimed to replace traditional hierarchies with a culture valuing employee autonomy and trust. This was driven by the adoption of roles like "The Leader," "The Coach," and "The Referent" to foster collaboration and empowerment. The principle of subsidiarity was applied, empowering every employee to make decisions, thereby promoting personal growth and responsibility. Moreover, they were able to work on an 80/20 basis, 80% of their work on their job missions and 20% on a project.
        </p>
        <p>The company also encouraged diverse career paths through "zigzag mobility," allowing employees to gain a wide range of skills by moving horizontally across different roles. Decathlon experimented with flexible working hours and a unique compensation model that combined base pay with bonuses, alongside efforts to create a workplace that enhances well-being and team cohesion through communal spaces and activities.</p>
        <p>However, this transformation faced hurdles. Employees reported increased workloads without corresponding increases in compensation. The empowerment promised often felt superficial, as higher management sometimes overruled employee decisions. Some staff felt unsupported due to a lack of clear structure, leading to confusion. Resistance from shareholders and criticisms over management practices that could lead to dissatisfaction or burnout highlighted the challenges in altering organizational behaviour and structure, despite Decathlon's innovative intentions.</p>
        
        <h4>Capacities</h4>
        <p>Decathlon's foray into a liberated management model underscored its remarkable capacities for innovation, adaptability, and visionary leadership. Historically recognized for pioneering sports products, the company disp
            layed a commendable capacity for adaptability as it ventured into uncharted management territory. Key leaders like Michel Leclercq and Frédéric De Clerck exemplified strong visionary leadership, steering the organization toward new paradigms. The introduction of innovative roles such as leaders, coaches, and referents showcased a commitment to empowering employees and fostering autonomy. Despite these capacities, the journey was not devoid of challenges. Resistance from shareholders and misunderstandings among employees highlighted the complexities of aligning leadership vision with external stakeholders. The need for balancing autonomy and support became evident as employees grappled with compensation concerns and organizational chaos. Decathlon's experience offers valuable insights, emphasizing the importance of a holistic approach to change, realistic expectations, and continuous evaluation, showcasing the company's capacities for innovation, adaptability, and visionary leadership.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Beliefs and values</h4>
        <p>Decathlon initially embarked on an innovative managerial approach, aspiring to become a liberated company. The core belief was to put forward a "humans first" approach, emphasizing trust in employees, reducing hierarchical levels, and shifting from a managerial to a leadership approach. However, the implementation faced challenges as the top management struggled to comprehend the essential ingredients for a liberated company. This misunderstanding led to a significant gap between the theoretical concept and its practical application.
            The attempt to remove hierarchical levels and introduce new roles encountered resistance, with employees perceiving it as a strategy to reduce costs and without providing additional revenue. The principle of subsidiarity put the focus on individual decisions, which clashed with the collective decision-making nature of liberated companies.
        </p>
        <p>The zigzag mobility approach intended to encourage horizontal career mobility, but resulted in inexperienced individuals making crucial decisions on subjects they didn’t have the time to master.</p>
        
        <h4>Sense of identity</h4>
        <p>The problem with Decathlon’s identity emerged when they faced difficulties aligning their actions with their proclaimed values. Despite the intention to embody liberated company principles, the company failed to demonstrate a genuine commitment to employees’ well-being and environmental concerns, key aspects of liberated companies. Today, Decathlon appears to have deviated from its initial goals. The absence of clear values underlines their departure from the liberated company identity. Cost-cutting and short-term thinking have become prominent, prioritizing profit over the initially envisioned values. This shift reflects a failure to integrate the liberated company identity into the core of the organization.</p>

        <h4>Raison d'être</h4>
        <p>Decathlon's pursuit of a liberated management model also revealed the company's keen sense of identity and its commitment to cultivating a unique organizational culture. Rooted in a legacy of innovation and a dedication to providing sports enthusiasts with quality products, Decathlon exhibited a strong sense of identity that went beyond its traditional business model. The willingness to embrace new roles and encourage "zigzag" career paths reflected a profound understanding of its workforce's individual aspirations while maintaining a sense of unity within the organization. Despite facing challenges, such as resistance from shareholders and misunderstandings among employees, Decathlon's commitment to its identity shone through. The company's emphasis on empowering employees and fostering a holistic work environment reinforced its core values. This journey underscored the importance of preserving and evolving an organizational identity during periods of transformation, showcasing Decathlon's capacity for maintaining a distinctive sense of self amidst change.</p>

        <div class="card-white">
            <h2>PATAGONIA</h2>
            <img src="images/patagonia.jpeg" class="patagonia">
            <h3>A SUCCESSFUL JOURNEY</h3>
            <h4>Behaviour</h4>
            <p>Patagonia cultivates a culture that deeply resonates with its environmental and social values, encouraging employees to embody the company's commitment to sustainability and activism both inside and outside the workplace. A standout habit among employees is their active engagement in environmental causes, supported by Patagonia through paid leave for activism. This not only enables employees to contribute to significant causes but also deepens their connection to the company's mission.</p>
            <p>The company's management style advocates for autonomy, allowing employees to independently manage their schedules and tasks. This autonomy fosters self-motivation and innovation, with employees encouraged to pursue new ideas that enhance product development and environmental initiatives.</p>
            <p>Collaboration is integral to Patagonia's culture, with employees participating in decision-making processes, especially regarding environmental projects. This collaborative spirit is evident in product development, where employee feedback is crucial. Furthermore, Patagonia encourages a lifestyle aligned with its values, with many employees actively participating in outdoor activities, reinforcing their commitment to environmental preservation.</p>

            <h4>Capacities</h4>
            <p>Patagonia's success can be attributed to a series of remarkable capacities developed and harnessed throughout its evolution. Foremost, the company exhibited a pioneering spirit in innovation, continually introducing eco-friendly materials and assessing the ecological impact of its products. This commitment to sustainable practices was complemented by adaptive leadership, particularly exemplified by Yvon Chouinard, who navigated economic challenges while staying true to the company's socially responsible values. The empowerment of employees stood out as a pivotal capacity, with initiatives supporting environmental engagement and the establishment of a dedicated Social and Environmental Responsibility Department.</p>
            <p>Holistic sustainability practices formed another critical capacity, extending beyond mere marketing strategies to include the incorporation of organic and recycled materials, carbon emission reduction, and a focus on product repair. Patagonia also demonstrated adeptness in balancing growth with values, navigating rapid expansion in the '80s while weathering the challenges of the 1991 recession without compromising its commitment to ethical business practices.</p>
            <p>The management philosophy at Patagonia showcased a unique blend of freedom and responsibility, embodying the principle of Management by Absence (MBA). This approach fostered an environment where employees were encouraged to work autonomously, contributing to a culture of continuous improvement and adaptation. Overall, the company's capacities included visionary leadership, sustainability integration, employee empowerment, and adaptability, making Patagonia a paradigm for businesses seeking to intertwine success with social and environmental responsibility.</p>
            
            <h4>Beliefs and values</h4>
            <p>Patagonia, under the leadership of Yvon Chouinard, is driven by a profound commitment to its core values. The company's identity is rooted in drastic and quick decisions aligned with its values, exemplified by the drastic and immediate abandonment of pitons. From its origins Patagonia has consistently embodied values of resilience, quality, and environmental preservation. </p>
            <p>The company's beliefs extend beyond mere business success, aiming for an economy free from insatiable consumerism and destructive practices. The conviction is to produce the best and most long-lasting products with the least environmental impact. Concrete actions, such as the creation of 1% for the Planet, reflect the commitment to environmental responsibility. Patagonia's values are not just theoretical; they are embedded in every aspect of the company.</p>
            
            <h4>Sense of identity</h4>
            <p>Patagonia has established a distinct identity as a responsible and environmentally conscious company. Quality, integrity, and a commitment to the environment form the pillars of its identity. The identity encompasses the entire business model and the impact on society and the environment.</p>
            <p>Their concrete actions demonstrate the company's commitment to avoid greenwashing. The identity extends to recruitment practices, favoring adventurers passionate about the environment over traditional office workers. The collaborative and liberating work environment reinforces the commitment to employees' well-being, fostering a positive workplace culture. The emphasis on employees going outdoors, engaging in activities they love, and contributing ideas reflects the belief that working less leads to better efficiency and innovation.</p>
            <p>Yvon Chouinard's retirement in 2022, coupled with the donation of 100% of annual profits to an environmental NGO, symbolizes the company's identity. Patagonia's identity reflects a deep commitment to environmental preservation and a rejection of the destructive aspects associated with traditional business.</p>
            
            <h4>Raison d'être</h4>
            <p>Patagonia's identity is intricately linked to a commitment to environmental sustainability, innovation, and a unique organizational culture. The company's journey began with a pivotal decision by Yvon Chouinard in the 1960s to halt the production of environmentally harmful climbing equipment, setting the tone for a brand deeply rooted in sustainability.</p>
            <p>This commitment materialized through holistic sustainability practices, embracing eco-friendly materials, reducing carbon emissions, and fostering product repair. Patagonia's identity is synonymous with a responsibility to the planet, positioning it as a leader in sustainable fashion.</p>
            <p>Employee empowerment is a cornerstone, evident in initiatives supporting environmental engagement and the "Advice Process," fostering a workforce aligned with the company's mission. Patagonia's identity is not just a marketing strategy but is woven into its structure, with a dedicated Social and Environmental Responsibility Department and B Corp status.</p>
            <p>Yvon Chouinard's influence shapes the identity, emphasizing quality, integrity, transparency, and partnerships. Patagonia's identity challenges business norms, advocating for a balance between profitability and environmental and social responsibility.</p>
            <p>In essence, Patagonia's identity is a compelling fusion of environmental activism, employee empowerment, and a commitment to challenging conventional business practices, inspiring a broader movement towards purpose-driven business identities.</p>

                <h2>HCL</h2>
                <img src="images/hcl.png" class="hcl">
                <h3>THE GOOD STUDENT</h3>
                <h4>Behaviour</h4>
                <p>Under Vineet Nayar, HCLTech fostered a culture where employee empowerment and transparency were paramount. The "Mirror Effect'' encouraged open communication, allowing employees to directly contribute to the company's challenges and solutions. This practice shifted employee behavior towards a greater sense of ownership and active participation in HCLTech's success.</p>
                <p>The inversion of the hierarchical pyramid and platforms like the Y&I portal democratized information flow, making open dialogue and idea sharing habitual among employees. This environment motivated employees, especially the "transformers," to take initiative and engage in innovative problem-solving, driving the company's growth and reinforcing a culture of collaboration and transparency.</p>
                
                <h4>Capacities</h4>
                <p>HCL Technologies showcased remarkable capacities in managing complexity, notably under Vineet Nayar's visionary leadership. The strategic deployment of the "Employee First, Clients Second" (EFCS) philosophy marked a distinct capability, emphasizing the centrality of employees in driving organizational success. Through innovative initiatives like the "Mirror Effect," HCL fostered transparency, encouraging open dialogue across hierarchies via platforms such as the Y&I Portal. Overcoming resistance, the company strategically harnessed change champions, or "transformers," to influence and gradually bring others on board.</p>
                <p>Challenges met along this transformative journey included balancing the need for stability with flexibility to foster innovation within the organizational structure. HCL's "Employee First" approach led to the creation of the Intelligent Service Line, empowering employees in decision-making and problem-solving. Leadership actively championed continuous innovation, leveraging the diverse talents within the organization.</p>
                <p>Key capacities illuminated by HCL's story offer valuable lessons for management. A people-centric focus, transparency, inclusive decision-making, a culture of continuous innovation, and adaptability emerge as core strengths. Tangible initiatives like the Y&I Portal and the Intelligent Service Line underscore the company's commitment to employee empowerment and transparency. HCL Technologies serves as an exemplary model for organizations navigating complexity, exemplifying capacities in empowering employees, fostering transparency, and cultivating a culture of adaptability and innovation.</p>

                <h4>Beliefs and values</h4>
                <p>HCLTech, under the leadership of Vineet Nayar, may not be fully a liberated company, but it adopts the key principles of liberated companies. The fundamental belief is encapsulated in the mantra "employee first, customers second" (EFCS), recognizing that employees are the creators of value and aiming for a shared reality of the economic and financial situation within the organization. The approach is driven by the belief that solutions to organizational challenges must come from every employee, emphasizing the importance of humility in leadership.</p>
                <p>Vineet Nayar identified four types of employee attitudes towards change: transformers, lost souls, waiters, and generation Y. This approach acknowledges that only 10% of employees are required to catalyze significant organizational change.
                </p>
                <p>The reversal of the hierarchical pyramid, putting employees first, customers second, and management third, reflects a belief in redistributing accountability for value creation.</p>


                <h4>Sense of identity</h4>
                <p>The identity of HCLTech is shaped by the EFCS approach and the commitment to reversing the hierarchical pyramid. The organization recognizes the importance of creating a significant and lasting change in the way it operates.</p>
                <p>The emphasis on trust is evident in the transparency initiatives, allowing employees to ask questions, share ideas, make comments, and communicate. The introduction of a new evaluation system, with a focus on feedforward (instead of feedback), reinforces a culture of openness and continuous evolution.</p>
                <p>Overall, the identity of HCLTech is one that recognizes the importance of employees in the value creation process and actively works towards creating a culture of trust, transparency, and continuous improvement.</p>
               


                <h4>Raison d'être</h4>
                <p>HCL Technologies, guided by Vineet Nayar's visionary approach, witnessed a profound identity transformation. Nayar's "Employees First, Customers Second" philosophy led to innovative practices. The "Mirror Effect" fostered open communication, addressing organizational realities. By inverting the hierarchical pyramid, HCL prioritized those at the forefront of value creation. Initiatives like the Value Portal encouraged dialogue between employees and customers, promoting shared decision-making.
                </p>
                <p>Challenges emerged in reshaping a deeply ingrained culture and aligning diverse perspectives. Nayar strategically focused on "Transformers," employees championing change, influencing others. Transparency initiatives, such as the Y&I Portal, laid bare challenges and created a platform for collective problem-solving. The 360° evaluation system promoted accountability and trust. Nayar's emphasis on spontaneous innovation showcased the importance of empowering employees to drive change.</p>
                <p>In navigating these complexities, HCL achieved remarkable growth, becoming a major player globally. The HCL story teaches organizations that embracing transparency, valuing diverse perspectives, and fostering a collective identity can not only overcome challenges but also drive innovation and sustainable success in the face of complexity</p>

                    <h3>SAME MANAGEMENT DIFFERENT RESULT</h3>
                    <h4>Behaviour</h4>
                        <p>Across these three companies, the emphasis on employee autonomy, trust, and engagement emerges as a common theme, yet the implementation and outcomes of these approaches vary. Decathlon's ambitious management transformation highlights the challenges of aligning innovative management practices with the practical needs and expectations of employees. Patagonia exemplifies how a company's values can be seamlessly integrated into its culture, enhancing employee motivation and company loyalty. HCLTech showcases the power of employee-centric leadership in driving innovation and competitiveness.
                        </p>
                        <p>The differences in outcomes among these companies underscore the importance of coherent implementation, clear communication, and the alignment of cultural transformations with the company's operational realities and employee expectations. Each company's approach offers valuable lessons on the potential and pitfalls of attempting to shape organizational behavior to foster innovation, responsibility, and a sense of ownership among employees.</p>
                            
            
            
                    <h4>Capacities</h4>
                        <p>Decathlon, Patagonia, and HCL Technologies, though operating in distinct industries, share commonalities in their remarkable capacities. All three demonstrate a commitment to innovation and adaptability, showcasing a readiness to venture into uncharted territories. Decathlon's foray into liberated management, Patagonia's pioneering sustainability practices, and HCL's adoption of the EFCS philosophy exemplify visionary leadership and the ability to adapt to evolving paradigms. Employee empowerment is a recurring theme, with Decathlon introducing innovative roles, Patagonia fostering a culture of autonomy, and HCL prioritizing the "Employee First" approach. Challenges such as resistance and misunderstandings highlight the complexities of aligning leadership visions with external stakeholders, underscoring the need for holistic change approaches. Ultimately, these companies showcase capacities in innovation, adaptability, visionary leadership, and a people-centric focus, serving as valuable models for organizations seeking to navigate complexity successfully.</p>
            
            
                     <h4>Beliefs and values</h4>
                        <p>Decathlon initially aspired to embrace liberated company principles, emphasizing a "humans first" approach and trust in employees, but failed in its attempt. On the other hand, an example of success in the field of liberated companies can be seen in Patagonia, a brand that embodies its beliefs, aiming for an economy free from consumerism and destructive practices. </p>
                        <p>HCLTech’s case is a different one: while not fully a liberated company, it adopts the key principles with an "employee first, customers second" approach. The beliefs are encapsulated in recognizing employees as creators of value and aiming for a shared reality within the organization. </p>
            
            
                     <h4>Sense of identity</h4>
                        <p>Decathlon's identity faced challenges when attempting to align actions with proclaimed values. The company struggled to demonstrate a genuine commitment to employees' well-being and environmental concerns, leading to a disconnection between its proclaimed identity and actual practices.</p>
                        <p>This was not the case for Patagonia, that established a distinct identity as a responsible and environmentally conscious company. The identity is shaped by concrete actions.</p>
                        <p>HCLTech's identity is shaped by the EFCS approach and a commitment to reversing the hierarchical pyramid, creating a culture that values adaptability and responsiveness. The emphasis on understanding employee thoughts and encouraging expressions of passion contributes to the identity of HCLTech.</p>
            
                    <h4>Raison d'être</h4>
                        <p>Decathlon, Patagonia, and HCL Technologies exemplify distinct yet impactful approaches to cultivating and embodying organizational identity. Decathlon's identity centers around a legacy of innovation and a commitment to providing quality sports products. The company navigates change by understanding individual aspirations, fostering unity, and preserving a distinctive sense of self. Patagonia's identity is deeply intertwined with environmental sustainability, innovation, and a purpose-driven culture. Rooted in Yvon Chouinard's decisions in the 1960s, Patagonia's commitment is reflected in holistic sustainability practices, employee empowerment, and a defiance of conventional business norms. HCL Technologies underwent a profound identity transformation under Vineet Nayar, where the "Employees First, Customers Second" philosophy drove innovation. The company prioritized transparency, encouraged shared decision-making, and empowered employees, leading to remarkable growth. Each company showcases a unique identity—Decathlon balancing unity and individual aspirations, Patagonia aligning with environmental activism, and HCL fostering a collective ethos around employee empowerment and transparency. These identities play a crucial role in steering the companies through change and complexity.</p>
